    <p> I have spent my summers at our cottage on Lake Leelanau in Michigan since birth.  
      The amazing beauty of this area has always fed my soul.  When I started painting, I naturally gravitated toward 
      painting landscapes of Leelanau. I also enjoy painting murals.  My life long dream of becoming a full time 
      resident of Leelanau County came true in 2008.  Now, my inspiration is always at my doorstep.
